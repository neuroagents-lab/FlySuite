# flybody_envs
This repository contains the environments and models of the flybody.

The environments follow the [dm_env](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_env/tree/master) API spec.

See `examples` for an example script. For more in-depth tutorials see [here](https://github.com/TuragaLab/flybody/tree/main/docs).

Some trajectories and the data required for the wing pattern generator can be found in `data`.

## Installation

The easiest is to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Using`uv run examples/example.py` will install everything in a venv and run the example.
